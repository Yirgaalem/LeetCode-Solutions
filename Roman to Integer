/**
Using a HashMap, I add each Roman numeral and it's number equivalent to the map. I then loop through the string character by character. I check the following conditions:
  - I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
  - X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
  - C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 If any of these are true than I remove 2, 20 and 200 in respective order. I subtract 2 if there exists a IV or IX because 5-1 = 4 = IV and 10-1=9=IX. Same for XL, XC and 
 CD, CM. I subtract 2 times the value of I, X and C because at the end, if I must add the value of the current character to the result for cases such as s = "III". Here, none 
 of the conditions are met and I must add 1 during each iteration.
 
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) ?? maybe
