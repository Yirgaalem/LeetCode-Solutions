/**
All numbers between 0 and 9 inclusive are palindromes, so we start by checking if 0<=x<10 if so return true, if not we continue. We know any number that ends in a 0 is not a 
palindrome so we check if x % 10 = 0, we also check if the x < 0 because any number less than 0 is not a palindrome, if either are true we return false. Lastly, if neither if 
statements are true we a temp and reverse variables. We set temp = to the last digit in x, then remove that digit from x. We then multiply the current reverse by 10 so that we can 
add temp to the end of rev instead of adding it as addition. We do this until reverse is greater than x. We then check if reverse = x or if x has odd digits, we check if reverse ÷
10 = x. If so we return true and x is a palindrome, if not we return false and x is not a palindrome.

Time complexity O(n)
Space complexity O(1)
